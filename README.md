# Who's a good boy
A simple app for using image classification to identify dog breeds using a machine learning model trained on the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

## Generating the model
The easiest way to generate the model is using the Google Colab version:

[![Open All Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ryanachten/Whosagoodboy/blob/main/model/DogModelGeneration.ipynb)

Depending on your machine setup, it is possible to run this Notebook locally. However, this is extremely slow when relying entirely on CPU (approx 179min to compile and fit model). Local development partially described below:

### Generating dog classification model
- Requires Python 3.9.0 (Python 3.10 not supported by Tensorflow at the time of development)
  - Ensure you're using the 64bit version of Python
- Create virtual environment `py -m venv env`
- Install dependencies (TODO: create `requirements.txt`)
  - Tensorflow `py -m pip install tensorflow`
  - Tensorflow Datasets `py -m pip install tensorflow_datasets` - TODO: not sure if this is necessary, pretty sure it should be included in TF install
  - Matplotlib `py -m pip install matplotlib`
  - Ipykernel (if using VSCode for development) `pip install ipykernel`

### Converting model
The model generated by Tensorflow must be converted into a format which can be used by TensorflowJS.
- First install wizard into venv `pip install tensorflowjs[wizard]`
- Execute `tensorflowjs_converter --input_format="keras_saved_model" .\model\saved_model\ .\client\public\converted_model\`
- Will format Keras model format exported from `tf.save()` into a layers format Tensorflow can import
