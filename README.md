## Generating dog classification model
- Requires Python 3.9.0 (Python 3.10 not supported by Tensorflow at the time of development)
  - Ensure you're using the 64bit version of Python
- Create virtual environment `py -m venv env`
- Install dependencies (TODO: create `requirements.txt`)
  - Tensorflow `py -m pip install tensorflow`
  - Tensorflow Datasets `py -m pip install tensorflow_datasets` - TODO: not sure if this is necessary, pretty sure it should be included in TF install
  - Matplotlib `py -m pip install matplotlib`
  - Ipykernel (if using VSCode for development) `pip install ipykernel`

- Currently configured to use TF CPU as the computer I'm using is not GPU compliant. Therefore model generation is extremely slow (approx 179min to compile and fit model)
  - TODO: investigate `tensorflow-directml` for Intel GPU compatibility. Will need to drop Python to 3.6/3.7 for this though I think

## Converting model
The model generated by Tensorflow must be converted into a format which can be used by TensorflowJS.
- First install wizard into venv `pip install tensorflowjs[wizard]`
- Execute `tensorflowjs_converter --input_format="keras_saved_model" .\model\saved_model\ .\client\public\converted_model\`
- Will format Keras model format exported from `tf.save()` into a layers format Tensorflow can import
